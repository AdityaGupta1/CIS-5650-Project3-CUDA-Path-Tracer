001 - basic path tracing, but I didn't realize that the lambert term is canceled out by the PDF (see here: https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/9499/confusion-around-lamberts-cosine-law-in-ray-tracing-in-one-weekend)
002 - sorting just the intersections but not sorting the segments in tandem (seen while debugging thrust sort)
003 - perfectly specular glass ball with another one behind it (not correct though since normals inside sphere were flipped automatically)
004 - glass but correct this time
005 - I have no idea lol, seems like the first bounce cache screwed something up (wasn't even enabled but I was working on it at the time)
